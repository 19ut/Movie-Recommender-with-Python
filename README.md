Introduction
The Movie Recommender System aims to provide users with movie recommendations based on their input. By analyzing various features of movies, the system suggests movies that the user might enjoy. This project includes data preprocessing, model training, and a user-friendly interface to interact with the recommendation engine.

Features
Movie Search: Search for your desired movie and get recommendations.
User-Friendly Interface: Simple and intuitive interface built with Streamlit.
Machine Learning: Utilizes machine learning algorithms to provide accurate recommendations.
